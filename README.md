charmander
==========

Charmander is a tool that fetches words/content from a database by linear similarity. 

Charmander is a web tool, coded in HTML 5, CSS, jQuery, Ajax, PHP and MySQL with adaptability 
capability that allows users to search for content in a database as they type, similar 
to the autocomplete tool in google search. This search is done linearly thus it does not 
filter the content in any way other than what has been previously typed. 

For this particular version, we will search through an english dictionary containing 22 words.
